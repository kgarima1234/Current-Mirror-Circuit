# Current-Mirror-Circuit using NMOS tech.
An analogue circuit known as the current mirror detects the reference current and generates a copy or a number of copies of it with identical properties. As stable as the source of the reference current is the replicated current. The duplicated current may be a multiple or a fraction of the reference current, or it may be the same as the reference current (Icopy = IREF).<br>

A current mirror circuit employing an NMOS transistor is shown in Figure. The reference current is changed into voltage, and the same is done between a MOSFET's gate and source.
